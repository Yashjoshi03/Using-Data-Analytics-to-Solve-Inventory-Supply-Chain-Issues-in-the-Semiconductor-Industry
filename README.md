# 📊 Using Data Analytics to Solve Inventory & Supply Chain Issues in the Automotive Semiconductor Industry

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to use **data analytics** and **machine learning** to address critical inventory and supply chain challenges faced by the **automotive semiconductor industry**. The focus is on improving **inventory forecasting**, **supplier performance evaluation**, **defect detection**, and **shipment delay analysis**.

Through advanced analytics and **JIRA software integration**, this project enables better decision-making and real-time tracking across the supply chain.

## 🚀 Key Objectives

- **Predictive Analytics for Inventory Management**: Reduce stock shortages and overages using demand forecasting.
- **Supplier Performance Analysis**: Rank and monitor suppliers to minimize disruption.
- **Defect Detection**: Use machine learning to identify defective semiconductor components.
- **Shipment Delay Analysis**: Track delivery timelines and optimize logistics.
- **JIRA Integration**: Implement an agile project management system to track issues and solutions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, ARIMA (Time-Series Forecasting)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Project Management**: JIRA Software

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Inventory Data**: Stock levels, reorder points, demand forecasts.
- **Supplier Data**: Delivery timelines, defect rates, and cost analysis.
- **Manufacturing Data**: Temperature, pressure, and speed metrics.
- **Logistics Data**: Expected vs. actual shipment dates.
